                    <p>Erlang is a programming language that was desgined to
                        create reliable massively scalable low latency systems.
                        It was designed for easing the job of engineers building fault tolerant and large scale systems. That is why, in contrast to most programming languages, fault tolerance, concurrency, distribution and tracing were built in from the beginning.

                        This page is a collection of the best articles, videos and books for learning Erlang, about its virtual machine and also about other languages running on top of it.
