                    <p>Erlang is a programming language that was desgined to create reliable massively scalable low latency systems. It was built for easing the job of engineers building fault tolerant and large scale systems. That is why, in contrast to most programming languages, fault tolerance, concurrency, distribution and tracing where built in from the beginning.

                        This page is a collection of the best articles, videos and books for learning Erlang, about its virtual machine and also about other languages running on top of it.
